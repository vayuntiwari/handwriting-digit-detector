    <h1>Handwriting Digit Detector</h1>
    <p>A memory-optimized CNN running on the RP2040 microcontroller that classifies handwritten digits 
    drawn on a resistive touchscreen, showcasing real-time inference despite stringent memory constraints.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Over the course of the semester, we found Lab 2: Digital Galton Board to be the most compelling project. 
    This lab pushed the memory limits of the RP2040 by requiring extensive optimization to fit a complex physics 
    simulation within the microcontroller’s limited RAM memory. Reducing memory usage by , we managed to incorporate 
    as many simulated balls as possible, optimizing both data structures and code implementation. This experience 
    inspired us to further explore the RP2040’s capabilities under stringent memory constraints, leading to the idea 
    of implementing TinyML on the same hardware platform. Given that machine learning models are traditionally 
    memory-intensive, we aimed to investigate how effectively we could fit a functional CNN onto the RP2040 while 
    maintaining real-time inference performance. This challenge of pushing the RP2040’s limits formed the core 
    motivation for our final project.
    </p>
    <p>The core of this project revolves around deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the RP2040 
    microcontroller to classify handwritten digits. The CNN is structured with quantized 8-bit integer weights 
    and activations to fit within the limited RAM of the RP2040 while maintaining a reasonable inference speed. 
    Input data is collected via a resistive touchscreen, which functions as a crude drawing interface. The touchscreen 
    readings are processed and mapped into a 28x28 pixel grid, which serves as input to the CNN. After classification, 
    the predicted digit is displayed on an OLED screen, providing immediate feedback to the user.</p>
